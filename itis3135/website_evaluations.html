        <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>

        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://www.apple.com/store">Apple Store Online</a></h3>
            <p>This is a well-designed website. Its effective use of CRAP design principle creates a visually pleasing and user-friendly experience. The website's clean layout and consistent design contribute to its overall appeal and make it easy for users to browse and shop for products.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> It effectively uses contrast to make important elements stand out. The background is clean and minimalist, allowing product images and text to pop. High-quality images with crisp contrast draw attention to featured products, while text is easy to read against the neutral background.</li>
                <br><li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Consistency is a hallmark of the Apple brand, and the website reflects this through repetition of design elements. Fonts, colors, and graphic styles are consistent throughout the website, creating a cohesive and unified look. This consistency reinforces Apple's brand identity and enhances the user experience.</li>
                <br><li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Elements are meticulously aligned, contributing to a sense of order and balance. Text, images, and navigation elements are neatly arranged within a grid layout, ensuring everything appears organized and structured.</li>
                <br><li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Related elements are grouped together logically on the Apple Store website. Product images, descriptions, and pricing information are placed in close proximity, making it easy for users to scan and compare products. Clear sections and categories help users navigate the site efficiently and find what they need.</li>
            </ul>            
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://www.arngren.net/">Arngren.net</a></h3>
            <p>This is a poorly-designed website. The products are haphazardly arranged without any consistency, making it difficult to navigate and find the desired information. The navigation bar is neither prominent nor clear, further complicating the search for product details. Prices are not prominently displayed, and the categorization is unclear. Moreover, the font on the product detail pages is too small, and there's no button to return to the homepage. This lack of clarity and organization can frustrate users and drive them away from the site.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> The website lacks effective use of contrast. The background is busy and distracting, making it difficult to distinguish between different elements. Text is small and blends into the cluttered background, reducing readability.</li>
                <br><li><strong>Repetition:</strong> There is little repetition in design elements throughout the website. Fonts, colors, and graphic styles vary widely across different sections, contributing to a disjointed and chaotic appearance. Consistency is lacking, making it difficult for users to establish a clear visual hierarchy.</li>
                <br><li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Elements on the website appear randomly placed without proper alignment. Text, images, and navigation elements are scattered throughout the page, leading to a lack of visual order and organization.</li>
                <br><li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Products are not effectively grouped together. Text and images are placed too closed to each other, with no clear relationship established between them. Important information is buried within the cluttered layout, making it challenging for users to find what they need.</li>
            </ul>
