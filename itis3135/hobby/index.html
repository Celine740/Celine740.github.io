            <h2>What</h2>
            <h3>Traveling</h3>
            <p>One of my passions is traveling because it brings me a sense of freshness, allowing me to explore diverse
                landscapes, indulge in different cuisines, and encounter a variety of people, thereby enabling me to
                experience the world from multiple perspectives.
                <br>And my absolute favorite destination for travel is Japan! The rich cultural tapestry, stunning
                natural beauty, and the blend of tradition with modernity make Japan an irresistible magnet for me. From
                the serene temples of Kyoto to the bustling streets of Tokyo, every corner of Japan offers something
                unique and captivating. Whether it's savoring the exquisite flavors of sushi or immersing myself in the
                vibrant energy of Harajuku, Japan never fails to leave a lasting impression on me.

            <h2>Who</h2>
            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I'm an international student from China. I really enjoy connecting with people from diverse cultural
                backgrounds and traveling. I have a deep appreciation for Japanese anime culture and idol culture. I've
                been teaching myself Japanese because I find the language both adorable to write and delightful to read.
                I've traveled to Tokyo twice, spending about two weeks each time, which gave me plenty of time to
                explore. I hope to visit the northern and western cities of Japan for my next adventure!</p>

            <h3>Seasons</h3>
            <p>Traveling is undoubtedly influenced by the seasons, and visiting the same place during different times of
                the year offers unique experiences! I've only been to Japan during the autumn season, where I could
                immerse myself in the vibrant atmosphere of summer and also enjoy the refreshing coolness of early fall.
                However, my plan is to visit during spring next time, to witness the blooming cherry blossoms. I also
                have a desire to experience Hokkaido's snowy landscapes during winter.</p>

            <h2>How</h2>
            <h3>Transportation</h3>
            <p>When traveling in Japan, it's essential to familiarize yourself with the country's efficient and extensive transportation network. The Japan Rail Pass offers unlimited travel on most JR trains, including the famous Shinkansen (bullet trains), making it a cost-effective option for exploring multiple cities.<br> 
                For shorter distances within cities, the comprehensive subway systems in Tokyo, Osaka, and other major cities provide convenient and punctual services. Consider purchasing a prepaid IC card like Suica or Pasmo for seamless travel on trains, buses, and even some taxis. <br>
                Additionally, renting a pocket Wi-Fi device can be immensely helpful for navigating Japan's intricate train schedules and using translation apps. Lastly, don't forget to check out regional passes and discount tickets available for specific areas or attractions, as they can offer substantial savings for your travels.</p>

            <p>There are many reasons why I enjoy traveling in Japan. Here, I find my favorite idols, beloved anime characters, and all sorts of adorable knick-knacks. Often, I don't just visit famous landmarks; I prefer strolling through ordinary residential areas and streets, observing what the local markets have to offer, grabbing snacks from 24-hour convenience stores late at night, all while admiring their cute little houses along the way, spend the afternoon in the park. I really love this everyday life in Japan.</p>
