            <h3>Traveling</h3>
            <p>One of my passions is traveling because it brings me a sense of freshness, allowing me to explore diverse landscapes, indulge in different cuisines, and encounter a variety of people, thereby enabling me to experience the world from multiple perspectives. And my absolute favorite destination for travel is Japan! The rich cultural tapestry, stunning natural beauty, and the blend of tradition with modernity make Japan an irresistible magnet for me. From the serene temples of Kyoto to the bustling streets of Tokyo, every corner of Japan offers something unique and captivating. Whether it's savoring the exquisite flavors of sushi or immersing myself in the vibrant energy of Harajuku, Japan never fails to leave a lasting impression on me.</p>

            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I'm an international student from China. I really enjoy connecting with people from diverse cultural backgrounds and traveling. I have a deep appreciation for Japanese anime culture and idol culture. I've been teaching myself Japanese because I find the language both adorable to write and delightful to read. I've traveled to Tokyo twice, spending about two weeks each time, which gave me plenty of time to explore. I hope to visit the northern and western cities of Japan for my next adventure!</p>

            <h3>Seasons</h3>
            <p>Traveling is undoubtedly influenced by the seasons, and visiting the same place during different times of the year offers unique experiences! I've only been to Japan during the autumn season, where I could immerse myself in the vibrant atmosphere of summer and also enjoy the refreshing coolness of early fall. However, my plan is to visit during spring next time, to witness the blooming cherry blossoms. I also have a desire to experience Hokkaido's snowy landscapes during winter.</p>
