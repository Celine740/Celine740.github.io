        <h3>Requirments</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>There are no spaces or upper cases in the file/folder names.</li>
            <li>The page has sufficient contrast and font sizing so as to be easy to read.</li>
            <li>The page has site colors and fonts using the standard “client.css” file.</li>
            <li>The page has main, nav, dynamic header and footer.</li>
            <li>The page has html and css validation button but did not remove the underline between them.</li>
        </ul>
            
        <h3>CRAP Design</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Contrast: </b>Nice contrast, clear background with text that is easy to view.</li>
            <li><b>Repetition: </b>Good repetition throughout the website, header and navigation bar look good.</li>
            <li><b>Alignment: </b>The alignment seems mostly consistent, with elements generally lined up neatly. However, on the home page, it seems like the text layout is too wide, and on the contact page, if the text can be centered, that will be better.</li>
            <li><b>Proximity: </b>Really good proximity, related elements are placed together meaningfully.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Opinions</h3>
        <p>When I first landed on the homepage, I felt like the background image was too large, and there was a bit of crowding between the text and images. The whole website gave off vibes of an old-school car. However, as I clicked through to the About page to read about the company and the owner, I realized that the website's design might actually aim for that kind of vibe, so there might not be a need for any design changes. Each page of the website offers very useful information, making it overall look like a meticulously crafted and mature website.</p>
